ORPHAN
======

    Dead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, right
    reverends and wrong reverends of every order. Dead, men and women,
    born with heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus
    around us every day. -- Dickens


    Holding this [keyboard] in your hand, sinking back in your soft
    [deskchair], you will say to yourself: perhaps it will amuse me. And
    after you have [played] this [game] of great misfortunes, you will no
    doubt dine well, blaming the [designer] for your own insensitivity,
    accusing him of wild exaggeration and flights of fancy. But rest
    assured: this tragedy is not a fiction. All is true. -- Balzac
